The SDLC approach I used for this project is as follows: plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain. My plan for the project was the easiest step since I had already had the idea of what I wanted to do. Since my family travels a lot, I designed a program that could locate hotels near a given address and provide some information about them. The design was where things started to get tricky. In order to retrieve some information, I had to already have data from other searches. At first I tried to design the logic in my head, but that led to me rewriting the script multiple times. After I started mapping the logic out on paper, the design started to make sense. Implementing the code was also not a very difficult task. Since all the data returned was formatted in dictionaries, I simply had to locate the information’s key to access the value. Testing the program is where the next problems arrived. I realized not all addresses can find the same amount of hotels and each hotel might not find the same information. It took some slight redesigning, but once I figured that out, I ran into some errors with the initial location search. Apparently, some “addresses” are able to get directions to them but won’t  find other information. So I had to use the other APIs to make sure the program wouldn’t crash down the line. Eventually, I was able to make a fully functioning program and am currently in the deploy phase. The maintain phase will include upgrades to the project which will repeat the SDLC all over again. I plan on adding a graphic user interface, some more filtering options, and a way to request certain hotels that the user may have preference towards.
