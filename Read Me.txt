“Hotel Locator” is a  program designed around travel. Users enter the address of the location they would like to visit, 
and the program returns a list of nearby hotels, ordered by price, distance, rating, or default order depending on what 
the user wants. The program may still operate as intended if given a more broad query, such as “Disneyland” or “Tucson”, 
but for the best results, addresses should be as specific as possible. Each hotel has a name, address, pricing, distance 
from location, commute time, phone number, rating, and a short list of nearby restaurants. To run this program, you will 
need a way to operate python code. The module “requests” must be installed on your python machine and the “InputValidation.py”
 must be saved in the same folder as the program. It is also important to note that this program uses the Google API system, 
therefore all information is based off of Google’s “Google Maps” data.
